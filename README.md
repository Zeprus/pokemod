Pokemod version 0.3.1.2 from 12/2019

This version was almost entirely created by me.

Uploaded for educational purposes. The current Pokemod has come a very long way from this version and is nothing like it anymore thanks to the effort of its current devs.
The Project won't build and please do not ask me for help with attempting to build it. It's been a long time, I don't want to put in the effort to figure out how to get it to build.

If you have any *specific* questions about the project or hooking methods feel free to create an issue.
But I'm no expert by any means so I might be unable to answer some questions.
